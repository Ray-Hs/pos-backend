## ✅ **What You Get**

Your backend is now **completely self-contained**! The `dist/` folder contains:

- 📦 **`server.js`** - Your entire application bundled (2.7MB)
- 🔧 **`package.json`** - Only native dependencies needed
- 🗄️ **`node_modules/@prisma/client`** - Prisma query engines included
- 📋 **`prisma/`** - Schema and migrations

## 🛠️ **How to Deploy**

### **Step 1: Build the Application**

```bash
npm run build:bundle
```

### **Step 2: Deploy the `dist/` Folder**

Copy the entire `dist/` folder to your target location.

### **Step 3: Install Native Dependencies**

```bash
cd dist
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```
